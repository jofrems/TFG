## Playing game

### We need to create a game and join

You can only play the games that you have created 
or joined.

 > Given there is your player,                           
 > And there is a game "mygame" created by "leonard".  
 > And you have been logged in.                           
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 > You should be at the player screen.  

### Seeing my playing games

 > Go to my playing games.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 > You should be at the list games screen.        
 > There should be 1 game.  
 > You should see the game "mygame" created by "leonard".  

### Playing the game

To join a game just click on the game name.

 > Play on the game "mygame" created by "leonard".  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 > You should be at the game screen.        
 > "leonard" should be the current player.    
 > Playing game should be "mygame" created by "leonard".  

## Validations

### You cannot play a non-joined game

You need to join games first. If not, you cannot play.

 > Given there is your player,                               
 > And there is the player "penny",             
 > And "penny" has created the game "alone".  
 > And you have been logged in.                            
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->                                  
 > You should be at the player screen.                       

Look to your friend games:

 > Enter "penny" as friend name.    
 > Go to friend games.              
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 > You should be at the list games screen.            
 > There should be 1 game.                    
 > You should see the game "alone" created by "penny".                 
 > You should have not joined the game "alone" created by "penny".      

And try to play:  

 > Play on the game "alone" created by "penny".  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=400 -->  
 > You should be at the list games screen.          
 > You should see an error message saying that "You should play only games in which you are joined".  

## Play your friends game

You can play the games that you have created,
but also the games that your friends have created.

 > Given there are players "penny" and "leonard"                                 
 > And "penny" has created the game "together".   
 > And "leonard" has joined the game "together" created by "penny".  
 > And you have been logged in.                                       
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->                                      
 > You should be at the player screen.                           

And now, play penny's game.
                           
 > Go to my playing games.   
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->                                           
 > Play on the game "together" created by "penny".                     
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->                                           
 > You should be at the game screen.                                
 > "leonard" should be the current player.                                  
 > Playing game should be "together" created by "penny".
