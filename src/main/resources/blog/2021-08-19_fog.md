# Fog

Did you notice that?
You cannot see the details of far away objects.

How many population has the city of the other player?
Where are their ships?

You do not know, you have to discover it!

## Fog of war

That is a pity, but not everything is visible. 

### Others cities

Start a game with leonard, and look at the ship.

 * Given there is "leonard" playing their game "together".
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * And there is the next player "penny".
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital".
 * The type should be "city".
 * The name should be "Capital".
 * The owner should be "leonard".
 * The location should be 0.
 * There should be 0 "leonard" ship.
 * There should be no population.

### Others ships

You can only see you ship.

 * Go back to the game screen.
 * There should be 0 ship from other players.
 * There should be 0 ship from "leonard".

### Trying for more details

Do you want to see more? Let's move your ship closer:

 * Let "penny" move their ship "Beagle" and wait to arrive at location 1.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * Go back to the game screen.
 * There should be 0 ship from "leonard".
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital".
 * The name should be "Capital".
 * The owner should be "leonard".
 * There should be 0 "leonard" ship.
 * There should be no population.

You still cannot see details.

### Being spotted

You can be really close to one city (distance 1), but you still do not see the details or ships at that location.
But, the problem, is if you are close to the other players (distance 1), they can see you.

 * Go to Next player.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * Go back to the game screen.
 * "leonard" should be the current player.
 * There should be 1 ship from other players.
 * There should be 1 ship from "penny".

But, they cannot see everything from your ship.

 * Click on the others ship "penny" "Beagle".
 * The type should be "ship".
 * The name should be "Beagle".
 * The owner should be "penny".
 * The location should be 1.
 * There should be no population.
 * There should be no destination location.
 * There should be no destination sail.

### Discovering others ports

When a ship arrives to a port, it sees more details about of the contents of that city.
Including the ships inside that city.
Let penny ship arrive to the leonard city.

 * Let "penny" move their ship "Beagle" and wait to arrive at location 0.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * Go back to the game screen.
 * "leonard" should be the current player.
 * There should be 1 ship from other players.
 * There should be 1 ship from "penny".

And now see what penny sees:

 * Go to Next player.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * Go back to the game screen.
 * "penny" should be the current player.
 * There should be 1 ship from other players.
 * There should be 1 ship from "leonard".

She can see the details of the city:

 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital".
 * The type should be "city".
 * The name should be "Capital".
 * The owner should be "leonard".
 * The location should be 0.
 * There should be 1 "leonard" ship.
 * There should be 1 "penny" ship.
 * The population should be 15.

### Third players

The third cannot see other ships on the city, if they are not on the city.

 * And there is the next player "sheldon".
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital".
 * The type should be "city".
 * The name should be "Capital".
 * The owner should be "leonard".
 * The location should be 0.
 * There should be 0 "leonard" ship.
 * There should be no population.

But if they go to the city, then details are revealed.

 * Let "sheldon" move their ship "Beagle" and wait to arrive at location 0.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * Go back to the game screen.
 * "sheldon" should be the current player.
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital".
 * The type should be "city".
 * The name should be "Capital".
 * The owner should be "leonard".
 * The location should be 0.
 * There should be 1 "leonard" ship.
 * There should be 1 "penny" ship.
 * There should be 1 "sheldon" ship.
 * The population should be 20.

### Spotting moving ships

Ok, there is limited view. You can see ships near cities, but not inside the city, until you dock.
But, you can spot ships on the see, not only from cities, but also from other ships.
So, if you place a ship in the middle of the see, you can see other ships passing.

 * Let "sheldon" move their ship "Beagle" and wait to arrive at location 3.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * Go back to the game screen.
 * There should be 0 ship from other players.
 * There should be 0 ship from "leonard".
 * There should be 0 ship from "penny".

If we get one ship closer...

 * Let "leonard" move their ship "Beagle" and wait to arrive at location 1.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * There should be 0 ship from other players.

They are not yet visible. But if a ship approaches...

 * Let "leonard" move their ship "Beagle" and wait to arrive at location 2.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * There should be 1 ship from other players.
 * There should be 1 ship from "leonard".
 * There should be 0 ship from "penny".

You can see it. But also from the other side, or even in the same location.

 * Let "leonard" move their ship "Beagle" and wait to arrive at location 3.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * Let "penny" move their ship "Beagle" and wait to arrive at location 4.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * There should be 2 ship from other players.
 * There should be 1 ship from "leonard".
 * There should be 1 ship from "penny".
 
And you see the same details than those from ships seen inside the city.

 * Click on the others ship "penny" "Beagle".
 * The type should be "ship".
 * The name should be "Beagle".
 * The owner should be "penny".
 * The location should be 4.
 * There should be no population.
 * There should be no destination location.
 * There should be no destination sail.

### Disappearing ships

When a ship goes out of range, it disappears.

 * You should be at the screen of a ship.
 * Let "penny" move their ship "Beagle" and wait to arrive at location 5.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at an empty screen.

### Tracking ships in your ports

If any ship docks at any of your city, it appears again (becomes visible).

 * Let "penny" move their ship "Beagle" and wait to arrive at location 10.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the screen of a ship.
 * The type should be "ship".
 * The name should be "Beagle".
 * The owner should be "penny".
 * The location should be 10.
 * There should be no population.
 * There should be no destination location.
 * There should be no destination sail.
 * Go back to the game screen.
 * There should be 2 ship from other players.
 * There should be 1 ship from "leonard".
 * There should be 1 ship from "penny".
