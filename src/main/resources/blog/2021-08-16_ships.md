# Ships

Imagine a city in front of the sea,
with a nice ship docked.

Will you board?

## Your ships      

### Let's see the ships

You can see your ships on the city. 

 * Given there is "leonard" playing their game "together".
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * You should be at the screen of a city.
 * There should be 1 "leonard" ship.
 * There should be the "leonard" "Beagle" ship.

### Details of the ship

You can see the details of a ship.

 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".
 * You should be at the screen of a ship.
 * The name should be "Beagle".
 * The owner should be "leonard".
 * The population should be 0.

### Changing the name

You can change the name of your ship.

 * Enter new name "Cerritos".
 * Click the change name button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->

And now you can see the new name.

 * You should be at the screen of a ship.
 * The name should be "Cerritos".
 * Go back to the previous screen.
 * There should be the "leonard" "Cerritos" ship.

### All players have ships

Penny can see that she also have ships, at least, one.

 * Given there is the next player "penny".
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * Click on the "penny" city "Capital"
 * There should be 1 "penny" ship.
 * There should be the "penny" "Beagle" ship.
 * There should be 0 "leonard" ship.

## Loading and unloading

### Looking population

In the beginning there was no population on the ship.

 * Given there is "leonard" playing their game "together".
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * The population should be 10.
 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".
 * The population should be 0.

### Loading

You can ask to load people on the ship.

 * The load unload amount should be 0.
 * The load requested should be inactive.
 * The unload requested should be inactive.
 * Enter load unload amount as 5.
 * Click the load button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->

But it is not loaded, yet, not until the end of the round.

 * The population should be 0.
 * The load unload amount should be 5.
 * The load requested should be active.
 * The unload requested should be inactive.

And the order persist, even if we refresh.

 * Refresh the game.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the screen of a ship.
 * The name should be "Beagle".
 * The population should be 0.
 * The load unload amount should be 5.
 * The load requested should be active.
 * The unload requested should be inactive.

### The next round

Running the next round will do the load/unload.

 * End the round.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * The population should be 6.
 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".
 * The population should be 5.
 * The load unload amount should be 0.
 * The load requested should be inactive.
 * The unload requested should be inactive.

### Unload

And unload likewise.

 * The population should be 5.
 * Enter load unload amount as 4.
 * Click the unload button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * The load unload amount should be 4.
 * The unload requested should be active.
 * The load requested should be inactive.
 * End the round.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 
And see the unload:

 * You should be at the game screen.
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * The population should be 11.
 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".
 * The population should be 1.
 * The load unload amount should be 0.
 * The load requested should be inactive.
 * The unload requested should be inactive.

### Exceeding city load

You cannot load more people than population on the city.

 * Enter load unload amount as 9999.
 * Click the load button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * End the round.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->

But you can only load at most the population that you had on the city.

 * You should be at the game screen.
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * The population should be 1.
 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".
 * The population should be 12.

### Exceeding ship capacity

Skip few turns to wait for population.

 * Skip 8 rounds.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * The population should be 9.
 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".
 * The population should be 12.

And load as many people as you can:

 * Enter load unload amount as 9999.
 * Click the load button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * End the round.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * The population should be 2.
 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".
 * The population should be 20.
 
You cannot load more than 20 people into the ship.

### Exceeding unload capacity

But...

 * Enter load unload amount as 9999.
 * Click the unload button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * End the round.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * Click on the "leonard" city "Capital"
 * The population should be 20.
 * Click on the "leonard" ship "Beagle".
 * The population should be 0.
 
You loose the population if they do not fit on the city. Sorry.
