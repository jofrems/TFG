## Playing game

### We need to create a game and join

Create and start playing one of your games: 

 * Given there is "leonard" playing their game "together".
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * You should be at the game screen.  
 * "leonard" should be the current player.
 * Playing game should be "together" created by "leonard".

Just make sure, that the next player is penny.

 * Given there is the next player "penny".
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * "penny" should be the current player.
 * Playing game should be "together" created by "leonard".

And back.

 * Go to Next player.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * "leonard" should be the current player.
 * Playing game should be "together" created by "leonard".

### See your cities

You can see your cities in the game screen.

 * "leonard" should have 1 city. 
 * "leonard" should have the "Capital" city.
 * "penny" should have 1 city.
 * "penny" should have the "Capital" city.

And penny can see yours:

 * Go to Next player.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * "penny" should be the current player.
 * "leonard" should have 1 city.
 * "leonard" should have the "Capital" city.
 * "penny" should have 1 city.
 * "penny" should have the "Capital" city.

### Change the name of a city

You can change the name of a city.
Make penny open the screen of the city:

 * Click on the "penny" city "Capital"
 * You should be at the screen of a city.
 * The name should be "Capital".
 * Enter new name "Pennyland".
 * Click the change name button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->

And now you can see the new name.

 * You should be at the screen of a city.
 * The name should be "Pennyland".
 * Go back to the previous screen.
 
And also in the general list.

 * You should be at the game screen.
 * "penny" should be the current player.
 * "leonard" should have 1 city.
 * "leonard" should have the "Capital" city.
 * "penny" should have 1 city.
 * "penny" should have the "Pennyland" city.

And leonard can see the change.

 * Go to Next player.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * "leonard" should be the current player.
 * "leonard" should have 1 city.
 * "leonard" should have the "Capital" city.
 * "penny" should have 1 city.
 * "penny" should have the "Pennyland" city.

### You cannot change others city name

You are the owner of your cities, others are not,
they should not change the name of your cities,
so you cannot change theirs. That's call
reciprocity, ok, sheldon, I know that it was
for your advantage.

 * Click on the "penny" city "Pennyland"
 * You should be at the screen of a city.
 * The name should be "Pennyland".
 * There is no new city name formulary.

But you can see it in detail.

### And go back

You can always go back from any city.

 * Go back to the previous screen.
 * You should be at the game screen.
 * "leonard" should be the current player.
 * There should not be a back button.
