## Check that tiles are initialized

Create and start playing one of your games: 

 * Given there are players "leonard", "penny" and "sheldon".
 * And "leonard" is playing their game "together",    
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * You should be at the game screen.  
 * "leonard" should be the current player.
 * The "vertex-1" should not have an owner.
 * Own the vertex.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->  
 * "leonard" should own "vertex-1".
